KrakenBot Alpha v.0.1

KrakenBot is a specialized IRC bot meant to log a specific channel, and provide some interesting conversational and functional
abilities.

AUTHORS: Ethan Phillips, penguin1263, nsuarez19.

This project is based of the premade IRC bot PircBot, and therefore, to avoid repercussions, we have licenced it under the
Unlicence. This means that anybody can fork, sell, or whatever the fuck they want with it, but it would be nice to have some
recognition.
